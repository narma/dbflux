# Skill Registry

**Delegator use only.** Any agent that launches sub-agents reads this registry to resolve compact rules, then injects them directly into sub-agent prompts. Sub-agents do NOT read this registry or individual SKILL.md files.

## User Skills

## Compact Rules

### branch-pr
- Use issue-creation skill BEFORE creating any PR (issue-first enforcement)
- Never create PRs without linked issue
- Follow conventional commits: feat/, fix/, docs/, refactor/, test/, chore/

### dbflux-release
- Bump version in ALL Cargo.toml files across workspace
- Update CHANGELOG.md with version and date
- Create git tag after all changes committed
- Run tests before tagging

### judgment-day
- Launch TWO independent blind judge sub-agents simultaneously
- Synthesize findings, apply fixes, re-judge until both pass
- Escalate after 2 iterations if not passing

### sdd-apply
- Read design artifact before implementing
- Implement one task at a time
- Run cargo check after each crate change
- Never break the build - cargo check must pass

### sdd-archive
- Verify all phases complete before archiving
- Update main specs with delta specs
- Clean up change directory after archiving

### sdd-design
- Include architecture decision rationale
- Document error handling approach
- Include sequence diagrams for complex flows
- Reference spec requirements explicitly

### sdd-explore
- Research codebase before proposing changes
- Identify affected modules/packages
- Document findings as exploration artifact
- Do NOT make implementation decisions in explore

### sdd-init
- Scan project stack from package files
- Build skill registry from skills directories
- Create .atl/ directory for skill registry
- Persist context to engram

### sdd-propose
- Include intent, scope, and approach
- Identify risks and rollback plan
- Reference existing specs/designs when applicable
- Use proposal artifact type

### sdd-spec
- Use Given/When/Then format for scenarios
- Use RFC 2119 keywords (MUST, SHALL, SHOULD, MAY)
- Cover happy path AND error cases
- Each spec domain gets its own section

### sdd-tasks
- Group by phase: infrastructure, implementation, testing
- Use hierarchical numbering (1.1, 1.2, etc.)
- Keep tasks small enough to complete in one session
- Identify dependencies between tasks

### sdd-verify
- Compare implementation against every spec scenario
- Run tests if test infrastructure exists
- Check cargo clippy warnings
- Document any gaps found

### skill-creator
- Follow Agent Skills spec format
- Include trigger in description
- Define clear patterns and rules
- Test skill before finalizing

### skill-registry
- Scan all skill directories for updates
- Generate compact rules (5-15 lines per skill)
- Write .atl/skill-registry.md (mandatory)
- Also save to engram when available
